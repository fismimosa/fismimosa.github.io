This repository contains the website for the MIMOSA (Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) project, funded by the Italian Project [Fondo Italiano per la Scienza](https://www.mur.gov.it/it/aree-tematiche/ricerca/programmi-di-finanziamento/fis) (FIS00001966).

## Project Overview

MIMOSA aims to develop a family of approaches to derive interpretable models from sophisticated algorithms accounting for ethical properties. The project employs advanced techniques such as Deep Learning (DL), Quantum Computing (QC), and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) to define procedures able to retrieve effective and interpretable models respectful of ethical principles.
