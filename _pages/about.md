The MIMOSA project introduces a paradigm shift from "data mining" to "model mining" that tries to revolutionize the theory and practice of AI and to establish an alignment between human reasoning and the logic of machines, bridging the gap between AI and cognitive science, and promoting the adoption of responsible AI systems. The project's objective is to define a methodology to extract interpretable, accurate, and ethically responsible predictive models for AI-based decision support systems to be used in critical contexts such as the medical or financial sector. To achieve this goal, MIMOSA aims to define a framework that exploits sophisticated algorithms such as Deep Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning to generate models that are not only accurate and interpretable, but also fair and respectful of privacy.
