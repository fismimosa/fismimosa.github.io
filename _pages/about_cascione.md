I am a Graduate Student of Digital Humanities from the University of Pisa and I am currently pursuing a PhD in the 
Italian National PhD Program in AI. 
My research interests gravitate around explainable machine learning themes, 
with a specific focus on case-based reasoning approaches to developing interpretable-by-design models. 
I am also interested in Natural Language Processing tools, particularly in the detection of harmful online content. 
Additionally, I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy from the University of Pisa, where I focused on philosophy of language, 
philosophical logic and epistemology.
