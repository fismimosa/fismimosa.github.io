## Project Objective
Define a methodology to extract interpretable, accurate, and ethically-responsible predictive models for decision-support systems. 

## Scientific Contributions
Design of a methodological framework for generating and Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated incomprehensible Algorithms.  

Theoretical:
* define prototypical interpretable models
* formalize manipulable model representations
* pioneer model generation procedures
* ethical-by-design model mining procedures

Methodological:
* cognitive evaluation of interpretable models
* implementation of model mining procedures
* estimate trust in AI systems

Practical:
* identify best procedures for problem settings
* guidelines to obtain compliant/reliable models
* open-source proof-of-concept system

Social:
* bridge gap between AI and cognitive sciences
* advance strategic objectives of the EU

## Breakthrough
The MIMOSA project introduces a paradigm shift from "data mining" to "model mining" that tries to revolutionize the theory and practice of AI and to establish an alignment between human reasoning and the logic of machines.

The ambition of MIMOSA is to provide progress in AI by developing a family of processes to extract interpretable and high-performing models using sophisticated algorithms. The outcomes will form significant scientific achievements as they will bring a comprehensive understanding to current AI practice and will foster human-machine interaction. These outcomes will start a new paradigm for designing decision systems that would be easily aligned with human values.
