Mattia Setzu is a researcher at the Computer Science department of University of Pisa, and a member of the Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Laboratory (KDDLab). His research focuses on explainable AI, with a focus on explanation of tabular and text data. Mattia graduated *summa cum laude* (2018), and then obtained his PhD in Computer Science (2022) with a thesis titled *Opening the Black Box: Empowering Machine Learning Models with Explanations*.

On explainability, he studies decision trees, their expressive power, and adaptation to non-relational data. On natural language processing, he worked on authorship attribution tasks, in which a text of an anonymous author must be assigned to a set of possible authors, and on fairness of language model, by studying possible causes of unfair behavior.
