I am a Ph.D. candidate in AI within the national PhD Programme under the area AI & Society.

During my studies, I explored the relationship between technology and human rights. I work on Fairness and Explainability in Natural Language Processing, focusing on digital discrimination and algorithmic biases. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Digital Humanities from the University of Pisa, during which I developed a strong interest in hate speech detection towards minorities in online discourse.
