I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Pisa, 
supervised by Professors Riccardo Guidotti and Salvatore Ruggieri.

I graduated with a Master’s Degree in Data Science & Business Informatics from the University of Pisa in 2021, 
with a thesis on "Boosting Synthetic Data Generation with Effective Nonlinear Causal Discovery." 
I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Digital Humanities from the same university, graduating with honors in 2017.

My research is primarily focused on the development of methodologies that discover and exploit causal knowledge to uncover and prevent discrimination 
and to promote the interpretability of ML models.
Throughout my academic career, I have collaborated with institutions such as INRIA in France and Saarland University in Germany, working on advanced causal analysis techniques 
for fairness in AI and dynamic systems.
