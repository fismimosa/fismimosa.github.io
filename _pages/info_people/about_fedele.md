I am a Ph.D. student in the National Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence for Society program at the University of Pisa.
I hold a Master’s Degree in Data Science and Business Informatics from the University of Pisa and a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from the University of Salerno.

My research focuses on developing human-centered AI approaches that emphasize explainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness.
I am particularly interested in the interpretability of Few-Shot Learning models, where I develop both post-hoc explainers and interpretable-by-design architectures.
Additionally, I am exploring the trustworthiness of AI systems in relation to the latest AI Act requirements.
